# The GoodGym App

### A single-page app to interact with the GoodGym API.

Built using AngularJS and styling inspiration taken from [Mailchimp's UX Patterns](https://ux.mailchimp.com/patterns/), where I've started to refactor and partial their rather large css file.  Further developments on this are welcomed! :)

#### Installation

This app was scaffolded with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).  It uses Grunt to build, preview and test. Bower handles the dependencies.

So first off, let's install Yeoman.

`npm install -g yo`

Yeoman also installs Grunt and Bower for us.  Then let's use bower to install the dependencies specific to this project

`bower install`

You should now be all set.

`grunt server`

Should now compile and serve up the application for you.
